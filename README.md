    Simple Interest Calculator

This repository contains a simple shell script to calculate    Simple Interest (SI)    based on user-provided principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

- Principal amount
- Rate of interest

It then calculates and displays the Simple Interest using the formula:

```
SI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

2. Make the script executable:
